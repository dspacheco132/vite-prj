# Vite + TypeScript + Docker Static App

This project serves static files generated by Vite (with TypeScript) using Nginx in a Docker container.

## How to use

1. Generate the `dist` folder with the Vite build (or copy from another project):
   ```sh
   npm run build
   # or copy the dist folder from another project
   ```

2. Start the Docker container:
   ```sh
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

3. Access the application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Project structure
- `src/` — TypeScript source code
- `public/` — Public assets
- `dist/` — Static files generated by the build
- `Dockerfile` — Serves only files from the `dist` folder with Nginx
- `docker-compose.yml` — Orchestrates the container

## Customization
- Edit the root `index.html` before building to customize the final page.
- To serve only static files, just make sure the `dist` folder is present.

## Useful commands
- `npm install` — Installs dependencies
- `npm run build` — Generates static files in `dist`
- `docker compose up -d --build` — Starts the container in detached mode
